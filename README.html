      <p>
        I did not start my career in technology. I earned my way here.
      </p>  
      <p>
        I have spent over a decade leading teams, solving real world problems, and being accountable for outcomes in environments where things break loudly and immediately if you get them wrong. Along the way, I realized I was most energized by the systems behind the scenes, how things connect, where they fail, and how to make them more resilient. That curiosity turned into a deliberate career pivot into Information Technology, with a focus on cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I am an IT student and cybersecurity practitioner in training, building skills across networking, systems, cloud infrastructure, and security fundamentals. I am especially interested in threat detection, defensive security, and understanding how complex systems fail under real world conditions, not just in textbooks.

      <h2 id="learning">Learning the Hard Way and Enjoying It</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to code later in life is humbling. My younger peers seem to absorb new languages the way I absorb coffee, rapidly and in alarming quantities. But that high bar is exactly what motivates me. I bring discipline, persistence, and perspective earned outside the classroom, and I pair it with a relentless drive to close any technical gap in front of me.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Progress over ego. Curiosity over comfort.</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">
        If I ever look too confident, it is probably because my code compiled on the first try. That is rare enough to celebrate.

      <h2 id="content">What You Will Find Here</h2>
      <p>
        This site is both a portfolio and a living record of growth. You will find hands on projects demonstrating applied IT and cybersecurity concepts, write ups that show how I think through technical problems, and tools and code I have built while learning.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If you are interested in practical security, honest learning curves, and someone who treats reliability and responsibility as non negotiable, you are in the right place.
